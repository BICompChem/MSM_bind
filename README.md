# MSM_bind
==================


What is it?
-----------
MSM_bind is an open source Python package to analyse molecular dynamics simulations in order to predict the binding site of drug fragments. In particular, it includes algorithms for:

  * Clustering and Featurization 
  * Markov state models (MSMs) 
  * Residence time analysis
  * Kinetic clustering
  * Uncertainty estimation 


MSM_bind can be used from Jupyter  or by writing Python scripts. For a tutorial, please check the MSM_bind Tutorial jupyter notebook and use the example simulations in the traj folder. 



Installation
------------
We are planing to include pip and conda installation in the future. Until then, download the MSM_bind.py script.
